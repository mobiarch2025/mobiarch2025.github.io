The concept was first proposed by Weaver in 1949 but was long neglected due to technological limitations. In recent years, however, advances in AI technology have led to the practical application of the
            necessary basic technology, and research is progressing rapidly. Semantic communication is also attracting attention as a promising technology for intelligent applications after 6G. This paper outlines the basic concepts of semantic communication, the technological progress through Generative AI, application examples, and future challenges. This keynote further presents a cutting-edge semantic communication framework tailored for vehicular communication scenarios, where key information is extracted from camera data and transmitted among vehicles and road infrastructure. The keynote will conclude by outlining open challenges and research directions.

				<b>Abstract</b>: Artificial intelligence today spans an unprecedented range of platforms, from microcontrollers at the network edge to large-scale servers hosting foundation models. Achieving efficiency and trustworthiness across this diverse computing spectrum is essential to realizing ubiquitous and dependable AI. In this talk, I will share our recent research efforts addressing these two intertwined challenges. In the first part, I will focus on efficiency. I will present AdaptQNet, which optimizes quantized deep neural networks on microcontrollers by adaptively utilizing heterogeneous processing units to achieve high performance under stringent resource constraints. I will then present our recent work, a co-designed framework that accelerates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM inference on resource-constrained single-GPU servers. Our design integrates a task-adaptive mixture-of-predictors with predictor-guided cache orchestration to minimize pipeline stalls during expert offloading and maximize end-to-end efficiency. In the second part, I will turn to trustworthiness, introducing our recent effort, a compression-aware semantic robustness training scheme that unifies model compression and robustness certification. By guiding pruning mask optimization toward flatter loss regions, this approach produces compact models that maintain consistent and reliable predictions under real-world semantic variations. Finally, I will conclude with a forward-looking perspective on cross-layer AI co-design, spanning hardware architecture to AI models, and discuss open challenges in realizing efficient and trustworthy intelligence at scale.

            Abstract: Internet services are assisting to an increased decentralization driven by needs, such as process efficiency, privacy-preservation, and energy reduction, and also driven by technological advancements such as virtualization, seamless computing, and integration of AI from the far Edge to the Cloud. 
            Multiple solutions are therefore emerging to assist in a more flexible and yet resilience realization of the Edge-Cloud continuum. One of such solutions is the CODECO framework, being developed in the Horizon Europe CODECO (Cognitive Decentralised Edge-Cloud Orchestration, funded by the European Union under grant number 01092696), with the purpose to bring data-network-compute awareness to Kubernetes, in the quality of the de facto orchestration system for containerized applications.

            Panel purpose: This panel, organized by the CODECO project, aims at discussing current challenges and drivers for the flexibilization of the Edge-Cloud continuum, by bringing together experts from academia and industry.-->

			Worldwide, the population is aging due to increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility. The significant growth in older population presents many challenges to health and aged care services. Over the past two decades, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant momentum and is widely regarded as an important technology to change the world in the coming decade. Indeed, IoT will play a critical role to improve productivity, operational effectiveness, decision making, and to identify new business service models for social and economic opportunities. Indeed, with the development of low-cost, unobtrusive IoT sensors, along with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there is now a significant opportunity to improve the wellbeing and quality of life particularly of our older population. In this presentation, we will overview some related research projects and also discuss several research directions.

              <td width="66%"><p class="text-justify"> Mobility support is a prominent utility service provided by cellular networks to mobile Internet. As the only large-scale wireless network with seamless wide-area mobility support, 5G/4G and its predecessor networks ensure always-connected experience for billions of mobile phones and tens of billions of things no matter where they are and where they go.  

 

In this talk, I would like to talk about technical challenges and progresses for 5G and beyond mobility. With advanced wireless techniques (e.g., wider spectrum, massive MIMO, small cells) and increasing demands (e.g., extreme mobility, 3D coverage, ultra-high availability), 5G mobility faces with not only new problems in emerging scenarios but also old problems which are deteriorated with the mitigation from 4G to 5G. I will first present our recent efforts to reveal and characterize the negative impacts of legacy mechanisms and policies for mobility support, and then discuss potential solutions and ongoing efforts in the community. There is no end for mobile network evolution, which pushes us to even revisit the fundamental limit of next-generation mobility support.   <br>

              <td width="66%"><p class="text-justify">Each generation of mobile wireless systems has spearheaded a revolution in the way humans connect with each other and consume information. 2G made mobile wireless voice ubiquitous, 3G ushered in the era of mobile data consumption, 4G significantly enriched the forms of media and communications and 5G expanded the benefits of the mobile wireless system well beyond mobile broadband to massive machine type and ultra-reliable low latency critical applications. This talk will present an overall vision for a 6G system to be realized towards the end of this decade. The drivers, use cases and technological enablers for 6G will be discussed with the goal of mapping the journey to a richly connected, intelligent system that will further integrate computing and communications, both wireline and wireless, and become an indispensable foundation for society. </p></td>
