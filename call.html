                    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
                    <p>
                    The last two decades have witnessed an extremely fast evolution of network technologies and a steep growth in mobile data traffic. According to the latest edition of the Cisco Visual Networking Index (VNI), global mobile data traffic is projected to increase nearly threefold from 2020 to 2025, reaching 184 exabytes per month by 2025. This growth is being fueled by factors such as the proliferation of mobile devices, the increasing availability of high-speed mobile networks, and the growing adoption of data-intensive mobile applications. Meanwhile, the integration of AI-driven technologies, including large models and foundation models, is significantly enhancing the intelligence and adaptability of networked systems, offering new opportunities for research innovation and development.</p>

                    <p>Globally, 5G network deployment is rapidly moving from trials to early commercialization, promising higher data speeds, lower latency, and improved throughput to support more simultaneous connections without disruptions. However, several challenges remain unresolved, driving further research efforts. Emerging applications are pushing quality-of-service requirements to extreme levels, while mobile edge computing faces challenges in handling user mobility in highly dynamic environments. Additionally, the adoption of open and intelligent network architectures is enabling greater flexibility and interoperability. Large-scale AI models are increasingly being integrated into mobile networks, enhancing decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and enabling predictive analytics. These developments highlight the need for in-depth research on next-generation mobile Internet architectures, leveraging AI-native solutions to address scalability, efficiency, and intelligent service provisioning.</p>

                    <p>The MobiArch 2025 workshop will focus on the technical architecture issues for next-generation mobile Internet, to tackle the aforementioned challenges. MobiArch 2025 welcomes submissions from both researchers and practitioners from academia and industry that explore the latest developments in mobile communication technologies and architectures. In addition, we encourage work-in-progress and position papers that describe highly original ideas, present new directions, or have the potential to generate insightful, provocative discussion at the workshop. </p>
